# dataDouble
### a project by roopa vasudevan

The first iteration of *dataDouble* (2018) consists of a web browser extension developed for Google Chrome. The extension tracks the URLs of all of the websites a user visits while it is running, as well as any text typed into the body of a website, including search engine queries and composed emails.

Through the collection of a user’s information, the extension then modifies and manipulates a provided photograph of the user to reflect the data clone that is sent to the entities collecting this information. Over time, the image, while still somewhat recognizable as a portrait of the individual user, becomes a warped and alternate representation of the self—the reduced, flattened version of the self that is used as a basis for the ostensibly personalized and extremely segmented experience that users have on the Internet today.
